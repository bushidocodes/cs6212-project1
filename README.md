This repo includes several coding challenges solved using Divide and Conquer techniques in C.

For those unfamiliar, Divide and Conquer is an algorithm design technique / strategy that seeks to divide a large problem into subproblems, solve those subproblems, and then merge the results.

A key idea is that the subproblems and the overarching problems are the same. They have the same inputs and outputs, and are thus commonly implemented via recursive functions. The difference is only in the scale of the problem.

The nifty thing about divide and conquer is that messy algorithms with bad Big O performance characteristics can perform acceptably well with tiny arrays.
